I am Christos Pitsikas, a software engineer, currently working at Sauter Automation Ltd as a
Control Applications Design Engineer.

I possess a BSc and Msc (Hons 2:1) from Democritus University of Thrace in
Electrical and Computer Engineering and
I am currently studying towards
an MSc degree in Data Analytics at Birkbeck, University of London.

My current professional role involves
designing and programming control applications for Building Management Systems (BMS),
analysing data acquired from various sources and predicting the building's behaviour,
with an emphasis on optimising energy consumption and sustainability.

My interests lie in the fields of Machine Learning, data analysis, controls and robotics.
During my ongoing studies, I am having the opportunity to delve into those fields,
strengthen my data science skills and develop fascinating applications.

In my spare time I read novels by Thomas Pynchon, theses on AI ethics,
and listen to jazz.
